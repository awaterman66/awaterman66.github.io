    <h1>About Me...</h1>
    <p>Hey I'm Alex, nice to meet you. I was born and raised in Columbus Ohio. Growing up I always had an interest in computers and technology. Mostly breaking things than trying to fix it. I ended up after high school obtaining an associates of Arts from CSCC. I then obtained my EMT and Firefigter II certs. After years of working as an EMT I decided to take a chance and pursue a career in tech. At first I tried looking into IT. As I leaned more and more I discovered coding. For some reason I kept coming back to coding and found a real passion for it. I found a local software development bootcamp called We Can Code IT and enrolled. My other passions include spending time with my girlfriend and dog. I also enjoy Muay Thai kickboxing and have been involved in the sport for 12 years. Not great at talking about myself, but feel free to reach out to learn more!</p>
